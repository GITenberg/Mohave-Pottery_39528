<p class="center large p2">FOREWORD</p>

<p>The pottery here described was collected fifty years ago by Kroeber and is all in the
University's Museum of Anthropology.</p>

<p>It is described for ethnological comparability by Kroeber, with emphasis on use,
shape, painted design, and names of designs; and for archaeological utilization by
Harner, with special attention to ware, temper, firing, hardness, forms, paint and
color, and technological considerations generally. The two parts were written independently.
They overlap here and there, especially on vessel shapes; but, after a
few duplications were excised, it has seemed advantageous, after adding a brief concordance
of terms employed by the two authors, to let the independent treatments of
shapes stand double.</p>

<p>No comparisons with other native ceramic arts, recent or ancient, are undertaken
by us.</p>

ETHNOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS</h2>
<p class="center">BY</p>
<p class="center"><span class="small">A. L. KROEBER</span></p>
<p class="p2 center"><b>POTTERY SHAPES RECOGNIZED BY THE MOHAVE</b></p>

<p>The generic Mohave name for pottery vessels seems
to be kwá&#952;ki,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the word for bowl.</p>

<p>The shapes for which Mohave names were obtained are
mainly those which segregate out objectively on examination
of a collection:</p>

<blockquote><p>kwá&#952;ki, an open bowl with slightly everted lip,
often with a band of mesquite bark&mdash;both bean mesquite
and screw mesquite are specified in my notes&mdash;tied
around the neck. The shape is shown in pls.
1, 2, 6,<i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, 8,<i>d</i>-<i>h</i>; the name kwá&#952;ki was specifically
applied to 1,<i>d</i>, 2,<i>b</i>, 2,<i>h</i>, 6,<i>a</i>.</p>

<p>kayé&#952;a, a platter, that is, a low round bowl or flat
dish without neck or everted lip, was applied to pl. 3,<i>d</i>.
The shape is shown in pls. 3,<i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, 8,<i>c</i>.</p>

<p>kayúka, pl. 3,<i>c</i>, or kakápa, also a platter, but oval,
and smaller. Pls. 3,<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>h</i>-<i>j</i>, 6,<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>kam'óta, a spoon, ladle, dipper, or scoop, more
or less triangular. Pls. 4, 7,<i>a</i>-<i>i</i>, 8,<i>i</i>-<i>k</i>. Subclasses
were not named to me, except for kam'óta ahmá,
those with a quail head at the handle.</p>

<p>katéla, bi-pointed tray for parching. Pl. 6,<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the last five names all
begin with ka-.</p>

<p>The name suyíre was given to pl. 6,<i>c</i>, which is
intermediate between bowl and platter.</p>

<p>táskyena is a cook pot. Pl. 5,<i>c</i>.</p>

<p>t&#353;uváva, a large cook pot, a foot and a half to two
feet high. I have seen one of these in use, full to the
brim with maize, beans, and fish, being stirred by
an old man with three arrow weed sticks tied in the
middle; but I did not secure one. It is set on three
conical supports of pottery as shown in pl. 7,<i>n</i>, <i>o</i>.</p>

<p>A still larger pot, up to a yard in diameter, too
big to cook in, was sometimes made to ferry small
children across the river, a swimmer pushing the
vessel (Handbook, 1925, p. 739). I would imagine it
would be least likely to tip over if made in the shape
of a giant kwá&#952;ki bowl.</p>

<p>hápurui, water jar, as kept around the house, "olla"
shaped, pls. 5,<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, 8,<i>a</i>. The name contains the stem
for water: (a)há.</p>

<p>I happened not to secure the name of the small-mouthed
canteen water jar used in traveling, as shown
in pl. 6,<i>h</i>.</p>

<p>A small-mouthed jar with short side-spout at one
end, too large for travel and probably used chiefly for
storage of seeds, is called hápurui hanemó, "duck
jar," from its resemblance to the floating bird. Pl.
6,<i>i</i>.</p>

<p>There are also handled jugs, pl. 5,<i>d</i>-<i>g</i>, and handled
cups, pls. 5,<i>h</i>-<i>i</i>, 8,<i>b</i>, which I suspect of having been
devised after contact with Americans, although some
specimens show use and the painted designs are in
good Mohave style. My doubts are strengthened by my
having obtained no specific name for either handled
shape: the high jug, 5,<i>g</i>, was called a jar, hápurui;
the low jug, 5,<i>e</i>, kwá&#952;ki, bowl; and in 1900 I bought a
cup for which the name kwá&#952;ki aha-surait&#353;i was given.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the dreamed Mastamhó myth of the origin of culture
(AR 11:1, 1948, see 7:76, p. 63), the culture hero calls
some of the principal vessel forms by two sets of names,
the first being recondite, twisted, or punning. The list is:</p>

<p>It will be noted that handled jugs and handled cups are
lacking from this list, though so are canteens and round
platters.</p>

<p>Small-and-flaring-necked spheroid jars, holding a
gallon or more, are found in the region, and in 1900 I
secured two Mohave examples which were destroyed in
1906 with the Academy of Sciences building. They served
to store seeds, and seem often to have been hidden in
caves and out-of-the-way spots by Shoshonean desert
tribes. I secured one near Needles in 1908, now no. 13875
in the Museum of Anthropology, but it belonged to a Chemehuevi
woman who was born in Chemehuevi Valley and was
in 1908 living in Mohave Valley, married to a Mohave who
was himself half-Chemehuevi. She had made the jar many
years before: in fact, it was the first and last pottery
vessel she attempted, she said. The ware is definitely
paler than Mohave pottery: a sort of half-yellow. It bears
on its upper half a red pattern, but this is fainter than
most Mohave patterns, and most resembles occasional
fishnet patterns on the under sides or backs of Mohave
bowls, platters, or spoons. It has 42 vertical (radiating)
lines and 7 horizontal (encircling) lines, resulting in 252
hollow quadrilaterals. The vessel also has two mends or
strengthenings with lumps of black gum. The overall
height, 225 mm., is 75 per cent of the maximum body
diameter, 300 mm., which comes at about 100 mm., or
less than halfway up. The mouth and neck diameters are
69 and 58 mm., or 23 per cent and 19 per cent of the
body diameter.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>POTTERY OBJECTS OTHER THAN VESSELS</b></p>

<p>Two figures idly modeled, or serving as toys&mdash;made
for sale, it was said&mdash;were found in a household: a
lizard and a hummingbird, plate 7,<i>j</i>,<i>k</i>, nos. 1726, 1727.
They seem at least partly baked, but have since been
washed with yellow ocher, which would turn to red on
baking. The bird also has a white-painted beak and spots.</p>

<p>I saw pottery human figures and dolls, both with and
without hair of shredded cottonwood bark, cradles, etc.,
offered for sale by Mohave women to tourists on the
station platform&mdash;Needles was a scheduled 25-minute
meal stop for most trains. I did not purchase any of these,
nor any small platters or handled jugs or cups, which
were sometimes also offered. This was perhaps a mistake;
but I was eager to impress on the Indians generally that
my interest was in native, nontourist objects. While
material was occasionally brought to me in town, this
was uncommon, and I secured most of it from Mohave
houses, especially native-style ones across the river in
Arizona. Typically, the bows and arrows hawked by a
few old men at the trains for twenty-five cents were not
the plain long Mohave willow bows, but red- and blue-painted
miniature willow imitations of the Chemehuevi
retroflex horn or composite bow.</p>

<p>Pipes, short and tubular, are made of pottery. Plate
7,<i>l</i> (no. 4264), was made for a boy, and was unfinished,
remaining unbaked. Plate 7,<i>m</i> (no. 13870), is a fragment,
62 mm. long, about 11 through the mouth end, 19 at the
break, buff-colored, with gray (overfired) paste at the
fracture. I secured at least one other pipe, no. 1719,
which cannot at present be found in the Museum.</p>

<p>Pot rests, put under the large t&#353;uváva cookpots, were
made of clay, as shown in plate 7,<i>n</i>,<i>o</i>.</p>

<p>In 1904 I secured an arrow-straightener of pottery,
no. 4367, shown in Handbook, plate 49,<i>f</i>. It carries a
longitudinal ridge, a sort of notched comb; presumably
to receive, after being heated, the joints of arrows of
cane or reed. However, cane arrows, though known to
the Mohave, were only occasionally used. The usual ones
of arrow weed, without foreshaft or attached head, were
simply warmed and bent by hand.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>TECHNOLOGICAL NOTES</b></p>

<p>I saw pottery made about 1902-1904, and have little to
add to the record.</p>

<blockquote><p>Clay is tempered with sandstone crushed on the
metate, and built up by coiling. The start of a vessel
may be spiral, but its body consists of concentric
rings. The paste is rolled out into a slim sausage, the
length of which is roughly estimated on the vessel. It
is then laid on the last [preceding] coil, and any excess
pinched off. It is beaten, with a light and rapid
patting with a wooden paddle, against a smooth cobble
held inside, and its edge finished flat by scraping between
the thumbnail and index finger. Then the next
coil is added. The maker sits with the growing vessel
on the thighs of her stretched legs, or with one leg
flat in front of her and the other doubled under. The
paint is yellow ocher, which is put on with a little
stick and burns dull red. The patterns are carelessly
done, and often shaky. (Handbook, pp. 737-738.)</p>

<p>In 1904, I added the following in notebook 60-33:</p>

<p>A "dish" [bowl] is modeled with the rim incurved
[or vertical]. Finally, the rim is turned outward with
the fingers, a few inches at a time; [to make the slight
neck which] after firing is bound with screw-mesquite
[a'íse] fiber. A small oval platter seen made was built
up circularly with rolls of clay, then additional pieces
were added on two sides and paddled even.</p></blockquote>

<p>I noted that no slip was being used by Mohave potters,
nor does examination reveal any.</p>

<p>In 1904, notebook 60-34, I noted: "If dishes crack,
they are mended by hair binding, or now a wire, being
passed between two perforations." I did not note how the
holes were bored, nor whether the hair was human or horse.</p>

<p>No. 4326 is a small piece of rock such as was crushed
and metate-ground for temper. It is not sandstone, as I
stated in 1923, but granite, according to my colleague
Professor Charles Meyer, whose courtesy is acknowledged
and whose information is summarized in Appendix III.</p>

<p>No. 4295 consists of several small slabs of yellow oxide
of iron, for grinding up as design paint, which on firing
makes the red ocher color which is both darker and more
saturatedly red than the light reddish-buff ground color of
Mohave pottery. Its composition is also given in Appendix
III on the basis of Professor Meyer's examination. Both it
and no. 4354 were obtained at matekwa&#952;-kut&#353;yep, "yellow
paint wide open," a spot in a wash cutting across the peneplain
from Avimota, Mt. Manchester, in Nevada opposite
Fort Mohave.</p>

<p>Several samples of material that might help further
elucidate the technology of Mohave pottery have unfortunately
been misplaced in the Museum since at least several
years. Quite possibly they have been put together into one
tray, which was then mislaid. They include:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1759, sample of pottery clay.</p>
<p>4326, sample of pottery temper, presumably after grinding.</p>
<p>4295, 4354, sample of yellow ocher for painting designs.</p>
<p>4277, piece of broken pot.</p>
<p>13871, two sherds.</p>
<p>1719, pottery pipe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another lot of similar accessories was once included
in a collection belonging to the California Academy of
Sciences and is listed in Appendix I.</p>

<p>I secured half a dozen paddles, kanó&#952;ki, for smoothing
the fresh coils of pottery vessels. All of these prove to
have been cut from white oak staves of whiskey barrels,
whose two-way curvature perhaps suggested to the Mohave
their adaptability for the purpose. Four of the six pieces
still show staining by iron barrel hoops. Three, however,
had had their concavity partly whittled flat. I presume
that in the old days paddles were made of cottonwood or
mesquite. The length and width dimensions of the "blades,"
that is, exclusive of handles, are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4276.......117...90</p>
<p>4311.......113..100</p>
<p>4346.......118..100  flattened</p>
<p>4347.......100...80  flattened</p>
<p>4348.........70...50  with 2 last makes a 3-size nest</p>
<p>13839......140...75  flat, almost biconvex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second and last of these paddles are accompanied
by their "anvils"&mdash;waterworn stones. No. 4312 is somewhat
three-cornered, 90-95 mm. in length, 43 mm. thick,
has one flattish side, one convex, and weighs 18 oz. No.
13840, though got four years later, is quite similar: 85-90
mm., 48 mm. thick, one side flattish, weight also 18 oz.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2 center"><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE POTTERY</b></p>

<p>All pieces are actually inscribed with and cataloged
under a number beginning with the prefix 1-, which denotes
provenience from native California. This prefix, being
unvarying, is omitted in the present treatise.</p>

<p>The objects described were collected by myself in three

<p>Of these nearly 300 objects, some 70 are of pottery.</p>

<p>An earlier collection, made in 1900 for the California
Academy of Sciences, was destroyed by fire on the day of
the San Francisco earthquake, April 18, 1906. Some notations
on it were preserved and are summarized in Appendix
I.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>PLATE 1: BOWLS</b></p>

<blockquote><p><i>a</i>, 13773, diameter 258 mm., height 127 mm.</p>
<p><i>b</i>, 1733, d. 233, h. 177. Design: ta-lame-&#952;lame,
"patches" (?). The painting is very uneven.</p>
<p><i>c</i>, 13772, d. 281, h. 140.</p>
<p><i>d</i>, 1715, d. 269, h. 151. Design, linear: ta-tsir-qa-(t)sirqa
face paint; dots: belly of yellow-hammer
(red-shafted flicker, kukhó). The outside is striped.
The execution is experienced, sure, light, and effective.</p>
<p><i>e</i>, 13774, d. 240, h. 142. The designs inside are
similar to those of <i>d</i>, and are repeated on the outside
of the vessel.</p>
<p><i>f</i>, 13778, d. 195, h. 97.</p>
<p><i>g</i>, 13780, d. 181, h. 89.</p>
<p><i>h</i>, 13779, d. 185, h. 87.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of these 8 bowls, 3 (<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, evidently from one household)
run from 181 to 195 mm. in diameter; the other 5,
from 233 to 281 mm. Proportions of height to diameter
are, seriated: 47, 49, 49, 50, 50, 50, 56, 59.</p>

<p>The pattern is fundamentally the same on the inside of
all 8 bowls, except that spotting is omitted in <i>f</i>. It consists
of triple-line bars that branch at an acute angle;
one fork soon ends, the second goes on and merges with
a branch from another bar, and so on in a complex pattern
extending over the entire inside. The forks&mdash;which
are also junctions&mdash;each contain a small solid-filled triangle,
into which the thin middle line of each bar runs.
Or, the middle lines might be said to emerge from the
points of the solid triangles. The two remaining lines of
the bars are therefore mere borders or shadows: they
never touch a solid triangle. The dead ends of the forking
branches point at each other, or inward toward the center,
in most cases: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>. In <i>c</i> they point parallel;
<i>e</i> is unskillfully painted and lacks the dead or free ends.</p>

<p>This pattern is complex and calls for skill in execution.
<i>e</i> is a botch, <i>a</i> irregularly crowded, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i> simplified
and open; the rest show successful control, especially
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>. Only <i>b</i> differs in that the dead or free
branches each end in a solid circle. The solid triangles
tend to vary somewhat in shape, from equilateral to
narrow isosceles, even in well painted bowls: cf. <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>;
this variation is perhaps unavoidable.</p>

<p>This pattern is the most ambitious of Mohave design
treatments.</p>

<p>The outer side of these bowls is painted with vertical
stripes down from the rim 6 times. Usually they are
thinnish lines, in <i>c</i> wider stripes. Bowls <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> partly
repeat the inside pattern on their outside.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>PLATE 2: BOWLS</b></p>

<blockquote><p><i>a</i>, 13771, diameter 246-260 mm. slightly oval,
height 115-118 mm., thickness 7.5 mm. toward bottom.
Weight 38 oz. There is a neck band of mesquite bark.</p>
<p><i>b</i>, 4321, d. 282, h. 150. Design: kan'ú, (Maricopa)
basketry pattern.</p>
<p><i>c</i>, 13775, d. 260, h. 100. Almost as flat as the
platters of pl. 3, but there is a neck, and it is bound.</p>
<p><i>d</i>, 1740, d. 210, h. 104. Design: coyote teeth.</p>
<p><i>e</i>, 13776, d. 266 (260-272), h. 140, thickness
toward bottom 9, at neck 4-4.5, at lip 5. Both paste
and surface are unusually yellowish. A neck-binding
has been lost, leaving a 20-mm. wide yellowish strip
paler than the darkened general surface. Wt. 37 oz.</p>
<p><i>f.</i>, 1732, d. 227, h. 130. Wt. 35 oz. Design, inside:
humanape, butterfly; outside, hotahpave face paint.</p>
<p><i>g</i>, 1714, d. 177, h. 121. The H/D proportion, 68
per cent, is, with pl. 8,<i>h</i>, the highest of all bowls. I
called it a "deep pot" when I acquired it. Wt. 23 oz.
Design, outside: (i)yamt&#353;upe&#7789;(a) face paint.</p>
<p><i>h</i>, 4292, "model," i.e., made for sale, d. 149, h.
77. Design, inside, halytô&#7789;a, spider; outside, atcí'ara,
fish tail. This vessel, as well as the platter 4294, pl.
3,<i>j</i>, was secured from the wife of Tokwa&#952;a, "Muskmelon";
he gave the account of Olive Oatman's return
published in 1951 in No. 4 of the Publications of the
Kroeber Anthropological Society, also dictated a myth
about the origin of war, and was accorded a running or
mourning ceremony on his death. He is a historic
character, having been encountered by the Ives party
in 1858 and mentioned in Möllhausen. He was one of
the nine hostages imprisoned at Fort Yuma and escaped
from there&mdash;a disturbance that ended in the defeat of the
Mohave in battle by Armistead later in 1859.</p></blockquote>

<p>These 8 bowls vary more in proportion than those of
plate 1. H/D ratio runs, seriated: 38, 45, 50, 52, 53, 57,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
68 per cent, average 52, as against 51 per cent average
for plate 1. The lowest bowl in the present lot is <i>c</i>, with
<i>a</i> next; the highest is <i>g</i>. These three are outside the
limits of plate 1.</p>

<p>The interior designs are less uniform than in plate 1.</p>

<p><i>a</i> and <i>b</i> show an overall interior pattern of solid rhomboidal
quadrilaterals or hexagons reduced to triangles in
the interstices and toward the rim; each such figure being
surrounded by 3 thin parallel lines. Where the outermost
of these enclosing lines intersect, two of the four angles
are solidified, producing secondary hourglass figures.
The effect is a bit like a tortoise carapace; but the design
was named only for <i>b</i>, and then as recalling an overall
pattern of basketry, which the Mohave do not themselves
weave or coil though they know and use it. In <i>a</i>, there
are four large hexagons filling most of the field (actually
one is more pentagonal, one heptagonal); along the edges
are four lenticular areas, each enclosing two triangles;
two of these lenses show in the photograph. In <i>b</i>, the
figures are grouped in four parallel tiers extending across
the bowl. In <i>b</i>, the <i>outside</i> carries vertical stripes; in <i>a</i>,
eight right-slanting and eight left-slanting lines enclosing
as many diamonds and hourglass figures, with solid filling
of the upper and lower corners of the diamonds and
meeting corners of the hourglasses.</p>

<p><i>c</i> and <i>d</i> are crossed by rows of solid triangles touching
at the corners. These aim at being equilateral in <i>c</i>
(the flattest of the bowls), so that the intervening background
spaces are also roughly equilateral, and there is
an overall dark-light effect. But in <i>d</i> the triangles are
narrower-based, or isosceles, and their points meet the
bases instead of the corners of triangles in the tier above,
so that the effect is one of pattern in rows rather than
overall. This is the design that was called "coyote teeth";
which fairly agrees with plate 4,<i>l</i>,<i>q</i>.</p>

<p><i>f</i> also has solid triangles, but they meet point to point,
leaving light rhomboids between their two rows. The
center is a lightly quartered circle; toward the rim, there
is a row of smaller, double, point-to-point (hourglass)
triangles, each set over the outer point of a rhomboid.
These outer triangles are each crossed by a bar of light
background&mdash;a feature not repeated in the collection, and
seeming strange to me; but it does yield a pair of miniature
solid triangles&mdash;that favorite Mohave design device&mdash;in
the waist of each outer hourglass. The miniature
solid angle also recurs in the central quartering. The
solid middle triangles as well as the medium-sized ones
toward the rim are followed outside their edge (or inside
the light rhomboids) by a row of dots. These rows of dots,
with faint lines, further extend to the actual rim of the
vessel, completing skewed hexagonal shapes of their own
(one is heptagonal). The design name given, "butterfly,"
probably applies to the point-to-point large solid triangles,
possibly to the rhomboids. On the <i>outside</i>, to which the
design name "halter face paint" applies, there are eight
double-outlined hourglass triangle pairs, meeting tips
solid, the rest of their interiors and the intervening hexagons
being stippled with oval, streakish dots. Cf. the
outside of <i>a</i>.</p>

<p><i>e</i> has been much rubbed in the middle, but the design
toward the rim is allied to those of the bowls in plate 1&mdash;triple
lines turning back or forking at acute angles.
Only the solid small triangles at junctures and ends seem
to be lacking. The <i>outside</i> carries 58 vertical stripes
averaging about 4 mm. wide.</p>

<p><i>g</i> is the tallest bowl, with a height-diameter ratio of
more than 2/3, due in part to a semiconical bottom. It is
considerably worn inside, and food has spilled over and
crusted part of the outside. The discernible interior design
is in a band below the rim. This is crossed by a
series of diagonals sloping downward to the right, with a
little solid filling triangle in the acute angle made by the
diagonal with the border of the band. In addition, a left-sloping
diagonal extends down from the rim to the middle
of the right-sloping one, with a filling triangle at the
juncture. The <i>outside</i> is continuously covered by what in
other vessels was usually called "fish bones"&mdash;but here
was named (i)yam-t&#353;uperta, a face paint&mdash;19 columns of
downward and 19 of upward pointing zigzags, all points
filled in red. Eight such horizontally progressing zigzag
lines are still perceptible; there may have been one or
two more, but not over ten altogether. This pattern is
most effective in a fairly high field (it is common in spoons),
such as this tall bowl affords on its exterior.</p>

<p><i>h</i> has free-standing eight-legged spider figures interspersed
with dots. A spider design recurs in plate 3,<i>i</i>;
and in 3,<i>j</i> a similar figure is called tortoise. The stripes
and lines of the <i>outside</i> were called "fish tail"&mdash;it is not
quite apparent why.</p>

<p>In summary for exterior designs, <i>a</i> and <i>f</i> have hourglasses,
<i>g</i> the zigzag fish bones, the others in this plate
"radial" or vertical lines, wholly or partly widened in <i>e</i>,
<i>h</i> to stripes.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><b>PLATE 3: PLATTERS</b></p>

<p>Plate 3 shows flat bowls, dishes, or plates, more or
less platterlike, sometimes round and sometimes oval.
They differ from the bowls of plates 1 and 2 in being lower,
in having no neck, and no outcurved rim.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the H/D ratio is from 28 to 38 per
cent; whereas that for bowls is from 38 to 68 per cent,
with 21 out of 24 between 45 and 61.</p>

<p>Platters <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> were described when collected as
"dish-like spoons" or scoops; <i>j</i>, like plate 2,<i>h</i>, is from
Tokwa&#952;a's household.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><b><i>Designs</i></b></p>

<p>As regards painted design, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> revert to the all-over
regular forking of plate 1, but with dark background
instead of light or spot-studded, so that the pattern really
is negative in effect. It is probably significant that the
only two platelike bowls carrying this design should be
the only ones to present it negatively. The pattern is
well executed in both. It is of course somewhat easier to
carry out regularly on a flattish plate than in an up-curving
bowl.</p>

<p><i>d</i> was called "himáka lame&#952;lame, its back leaves"
(or "patches"?&mdash;cf. pl. 4,<i>d</i>). This presumably refers to
the large dot-studded hexagonal areas&mdash;hexagonal at
least in intent. My notes also name a "t&#353;it&#952;ôk face-paint"
design, which would then be the name of the interconnected
hourglass figures which constitute the primary or
positive element of the patterning. The combination of
these two design elements recurs on the exterior of the
jar of plate 8,<i>a</i>. The back or <i>under</i> side of <i>d</i> in the present
plate is boldly checkered, as shown in plate 8,<i>c</i>. It
is possible that the leaf name refers to this checker.</p>

<p><i>c</i> and <i>g</i> were both designated as fish backbone, which
as a pattern we have already encountered on bowl 2,<i>g</i>,
though there on the outer side and named after a face
paint: parallel zigzags with solid-filled angles. The idea
seems to be that of a fish backbone as it might be drawn
out with ribs attached&mdash;"herringbone" in our own nomenclature.
Then 3,<i>g</i> would be the more representational
form with the vertebral column left in&mdash;though it is also
partway transitional to the triple-line angle-and-forking
pattern of plate 1 and of 3,<i>a</i>,<i>b</i> above. The simpler,
merely parallel-chevron form of the design&mdash;with the
vertebrae omitted&mdash;is perhaps more usual, and is shown
recurring in <i>e</i> and in plate 4,<i>f</i>,<i>k</i>. The under side of <i>c</i>
has 67 vertical (radiating) lines.&mdash;Plate 3,<i>g</i>, no. 1751,
was obtained from Nyavarup along with no. 1749, plate
4,<i>o</i>, which see. Nyavarup, like Tokwa&#952;a, was a historic
character, having been encountered by the Ives party in
1858 and mentioned in Möllhausen. In 1902 he told me the
creation, which will be published as myth no. 9.</p>

<p><i>f</i> is the <i>under</i> or convex side of <i>e</i>, but its spots (12-14
mm. diameter) reappear as the sole inside pattern in <i>h</i>,
and between the tortoises of <i>j</i>. The inside dots of <i>h</i> and
the outside ones of <i>f</i> were however put on differently: in
<i>h</i> in rows across the oval, in <i>f</i> irregularly or perhaps
spirally. The under side of <i>h</i> also has dots, fainter than
on the front. In <i>j</i> the dots seem inserted with reference
to the larger figures of tortoises.</p>

<p>These tortoises of <i>j</i> are definitely similar to the
halytô&#7789;a spiders of plate 2,<i>h</i>, but are also distinctive,
with enclosed-line quadrilateral body, 3-toed legs at
corners, and head and tail. Both 3,<i>j</i> and 2,<i>h</i> however
were made to sell, are more representational than most
Mohave pottery paintings, and should be viewed with a
degree of reserve, though I believe that their designs
have basis in native usage.</p>

<p>3,<i>i</i> as halytô&#7789;a, spider, is puzzling as to why its name,
and is also abnormal formally.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>PLATE 4: SPOONS</b></p>

<p>These are ladles, dippers, scoops, as one will, but I
retain the "spoon" which the Mohave most often gave as
their English term for native kam'óta. They are of course
not taken into the mouth, but held to it while gruel flows
out; or perhaps more often they serve as a convenient
holder of an individual or temporary portion which is
scooped into the mouth with two or three fingers which
are then sucked off. They also serve to ladle boiled food
from large cook pots into bowls or platters.</p>

<p>I give, first, identifications, sizes, and design names;
then shapes; and finally a discussion of painted patterns.</p>

<p class="center"><b><i>Shapes</i></b></p>

<p>Hollow, rattling handles, consisting of a three-cornered
box, are found on <i>e</i>,<i>f</i>,<i>r</i>. In each case, the end is modeled
into a rude quail's head, showing eyes and beak (or topknot?).</p>

<p>Some rudiments of a quail head, but without hollow compartment,
appear also in <i>a</i>-<i>d</i>,<i>q</i>; possibly in <i>i</i>,<i>k</i>.</p>

<p>The foregoing have the outer edges, toward the top,
somewhat raised and a bit incurved. This sort of an edge
shows also in <i>g</i>,<i>h</i>,<i>j</i>, which however possess no rudiments
of the quail's head. The edge faces forward (if the hollow
of the spoon is regarded as its front).</p>

<p>Another group of spoons have their edge rather turned
outward&mdash;that is, away from the hollow. This group includes
<i>l</i>-<i>p</i> and <i>s</i>. These average somewhat flatter, and
the apex is generally rounder, than in those with forward-turned
edge: see especially <i>n</i>,<i>o</i>,<i>p</i>,<i>s</i>; also <i>m</i>; only <i>l</i>
comes to a point. Also, the total width ratio is greater in
this group.</p>

<p>The classification thus is:</p>

<p>A. Edge raised, turned forward; apex pointed<br />
<span class="i2">1. Quail head apex, hollow rattling compartment</span><br />
<span class="i2">2. Quail head or rudiment</span><br />

</table></div>
<p class="center">Note A: Handle retroflex</p>

<p>It will be seen that all four subclasses of spoons are
represented by examples both above and below the median
178 mm. length. Also, the three longest spoons in the
collection belong to three different subclasses. The
salient feature is that the blunt-ended "B" spoons have a
bimodal distribution: from 198 mm. up, from 156 down.
I should not be surprised if B forms turned up in the intervening
range; but I should expect the bimodality to remain
even if many additional specimens became available.</p>

<p>For the rest, it may be significant that the pointed-end
classes A2, A3 are unrepresented below 170; and the
clear quail-head (and rattle-box) class A1 not above 195.
It may be that beyond a certain size the firing of the juxtaposed
solid head and hollow rattle was difficult for the
Mohave.</p>

<p class="center"><b><i>Designs</i></b></p>

<p>The great majority of spoons are painted inside, usually
outside (on the back) also, though there mostly with longitudinal
lines or stripes only.</p>

<p>The angled-and-forking overall pattern so characteristic
of bowls occurs in spoons, but is rare: <i>b</i> is an example.
The area of a scoop is generally hardly wide and large
enough for this design. In <i>b</i> it reduces in effect to a sort
of cramped swastika.</p>

<p>One of the two most frequent patterns of spoons is that
of <i>g</i>,<i>h</i>,<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>,<i>m</i>&mdash;the last in negative effect and unsprinkled
with dots. The central feature is a column of three (or two
and a half) rhomboids. These are flanked and meshed by
four (or three) triangles. The rhomboids and the triangles
are separated by three lines, making, with their own
boundaries, five parallel lines in all (though this number
is sometimes reduced); and where points of triangles meet
(and sometimes of rhomboids also) the corners are solid.
It is obvious that this pattern is related in several features
to the commonest pattern of bowls, but with adaptation to
a more cramped field&mdash;chiefly by omission of forking and
back-angled elements. The only name obtained&mdash;once&mdash;was
kyauelkyau, which is said to mean zigzag or angled.</p>

<p>Another spoon pattern has two or three tiers of light
rhomboids separated by pairs of dark triangles, apex to
apex (hourglass): see <i>a</i>,<i>d</i>. There is no thin-line bordering
or separating in this pattern. For <i>d</i>, the design names
cited were ta-hlame-hlame, "patches," and "butterfly inside";
but I do not know which of these names refers to the
hollow rhomboids and which to the paired solid triangles.</p>

<p>Another tiered design arrangement is shown in <i>l</i> and <i>q</i>.
Both were called coyote teeth, which speaks for itself. It
will be seen that the teeth are in opposite rows, geared
into diastemas&mdash;which does not hold for plate 2,<i>d</i>. In one
of these spoons the solid-color teeth have a line border,
in the other a row of dots. In both there are two longer
double-toothed bands across the middle, two shorter one-way-facing
bands of teeth at the ends. "Coyote teeth" appears
as a face paint&mdash;a cross-barred line&mdash;in Handbook,
figure 61,<i>b</i>.</p>

<p>A second design of outstanding frequency in spoons is
represented by <i>e</i>,<i>f</i>,<i>k</i>,<i>o</i>, (s). It was twice designated as
fish backbone (with adhering ribs). The backbone itself
appears only twice in the five examples in plate 4 (<i>e</i>,<i>o</i>),
and is by no means dominant then. The sets of parallel
ribs or chevrons number from 10 to nearly 20, and make
either 3 or 5 bends (i.e., are formed by 4 or 6 lines). The
bends are filled in with small solid triangles in <i>f</i>,<i>k</i>,<i>s</i>.
Rows of dots show in <i>e</i> and <i>s</i>.</p>

<p>Other designs each occur only once in the collection.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, polka dots only.</p>

<p><i>n</i>, a fishnetlike design, no name obtained, vertical
corners filled in solidly.</p>

<p><i>p</i>, raccoon hand (first mistranslated "otter," but the
otter is "water-raccoon" in Mohave), with five hollow-line
toes, background of fine dots. There is some reminiscence
of the forking bowl design, but without angling back or hooks.</p>

<p><i>s</i>, perhaps a simplified version of the pattern of <i>g</i>-<i>j</i>,<i>m</i>?</p>

<p>There is no marked correlation between any of these
designs and the shape classes of spoons that have been
defined.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>PLATE 5: JARS, POTS, JUGS, CUPS</b></p>

<blockquote><p><i>a</i>, water jar, 1723, recorded as "hápurui, small
olla for seeds, or for water in summer"; diameter
mouth 128 mm., height 200 mm. Neck d. about 83 per
cent of mouth, body d. about double that of neck and
greater than height. There is an annular base which is
not present in the two other water jars. Design: t&#353;it&#952;ôk
style of face paint.</p>

<p><i>b</i>, water jar, 13792, mouth d. 177, h. 194. Neck d.
81 per cent of mouth, body d. equals height.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, fire-blackened cook pot, 13789, mouth d. 250, h.
192. Neck d, 227, body d. 250.</p>

<p><i>d</i>, handled jug (spoutless pitcher), 1725, mouth d.
85, h. 95. Design: ta-skilye-skilye, viz., outside
points of chin tattooing.</p>

<p><i>e</i>, handled jug, 1724, mouth d. 86, h. 90. Design:
hotahpave, viz., halter pattern of face painting.</p>

<p><i>f</i>, handled jug, 13795, mouth d. 105, h. 147. This
piece had not been used when collected, and may have
been a model for sale.</p>

<p><i>g</i>, handled jug, 1739, called hápurui, jar, mouth d.
92, h. 140. Design: fish backbone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p><i>h</i>, small, handled cup, 13796, mouth d. 88, h. 47.
Used and somewhat worn.</p>

<p><i>i</i>, handled cup, 2-7359, mouth d. 128, h. 90. From
older (pre-1901) University collections, provenience
and collector not recorded. Assumed to be Mohave,
but condition suggests the vessel was made for sale
and not used.</p></blockquote>

<p>The two water jars are of about the same height,
toward 8 in., but <i>a</i> is smaller-mouthed and bigger-bellied
than <i>b</i>. The neck diameters are around 5/6 to 4/5 of the
mouths. <i>a</i> is somewhat greater through the body than it
is high; <i>b</i>, nearly the same. Another and larger jar is
shown in plate 8,<i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The cook pot, <i>c</i>, has the opening as large as the body
diameter; the neck is only 9 to 10 per cent smaller than
the mouth, the height only 77 per cent of the width. This
pot is somewhat higher in silhouette proportion than any
of the bowls, but not much higher than the highest of them,
viz., 2,<i>g</i> and 8,<i>h</i>.</p>

<p>The four handled jugs fall into two classes: <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>,
medium; <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>, high. In the former, the height is about
a tenth greater than the mouth diameter, in the latter,
about a half greater. Also, in the medium jugs, the base
of the handle springs from the lower half of the vessel;
in the high ones, from the middle or above. In all cases
the handle rises somewhat above the lip. The neck is less
than the mouth by 12 to 15 per cent.</p>

<p>The cups are like the jugs except that they are lower
and the main painted designs come inside. In fact, the
cups seem to be small bowls with a handle attached.</p>

<p>I am quite uncertain whether the handled jugs and cups
are native Mohave forms or derived in imitation of Caucasian
shapes. It is unclear what specific function their
handles would have served in Mohave life, in sand-floored
houses empty of furniture or apparatus. Yet probably <i>g</i>
and certainly <i>h</i> have been used. And the ware of the jugs
and cups, as well as their painted designs, are typical
Mohave. They look like an "acculturation acceptance"&mdash;a
new trait adopted into the old native pattern. The
problem will probably be solved when enough datable precontact
and protocontact ware from the Mohave and kindred
Yuman tribes becomes available.</p>

<p>With these round vessels the forking-and-angled design
of the bowl interiors recurs: in the jar <i>a</i>, the jug <i>f</i>,
on the interior of cup <i>i</i>. It will be seen that these come
with and without dot stippling. The pattern of jug <i>d</i> was
called tattoo points; but it is the same as the coyote teeth
of plate 4,<i>l</i>,<i>q</i>. Similarly, <i>e</i>, though called hotahpave
halter, resembles plate 4,<i>g</i>-<i>i</i>; and <i>g</i>, called fish backbone,
lines up with the fish backbone designs on spoons:
plate 4,<i>e</i>,<i>f</i>,<i>k</i>,<i>o</i>,<i>s</i>.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><b>PLATE 6: BOWLS, PLATTERS,
PARCHERS, CANTEENS</b></p>

<blockquote><p><i>a</i>, bowl, 4293; diameter 151 mm., height 76 mm.
Design: inside, raccoon hand; outside, fish bone, atcí
isáka.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This is from Tokwa&#952;a's wife.</p>

<p><i>b</i>, broken bowl, 4282; d. 157, h. 85. Design;
raccoon hand.</p>

<p><i>c</i>. large bowl or platter, 1745, of type called suyíre,
d. 330, h. 125. Weight, 44 oz. The flanges to hold
mesquite bark binding in place are unusually prominent.</p>

<p>This is the largest and second heaviest round vessel
in the collection; but it is low, 38 per cent of the
diameter&mdash;at the minimum for bowls, maximum for
platters. It is not strictly a bowl, because there is no
neck constriction: the vessel curves in unbroken convexity
up to the rim. On the other hand it is not a
typical platter because it has flanges and is bound like
a bowl. There are 11 of these flanges, 25 to 35 mm.
long, projecting 5 to 8 mm., and spaced quite irregularly,
with 120, 95, 90, 55, 85, 65, 115, 95, 75, 120,
75 mm. between their centers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bowls <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are grouped together because of
their raccoon-hand designs; compare also plate 4,<i>p</i>.
Bowl <i>a</i> looks unused and may have been made for sale;
<i>b</i> has been used and is probably from the same house,
though almost certainly not painted by the same person.</p>

<p>The large platter-bowl <i>c</i> has its painted design built
up around four big rhomboids or hexagons, nearly rounded
into pointed ovoids with triple solid tips; between which
similarly pointed triangles project toward the center from
the rim.</p>

<p>The oval platters <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, nos. 1738, 4294, are the
convex backs or under sides of plate 3,<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>. The former
looks used, the latter new and perhaps for sale. The tortoises
on the under (6,<i>e</i>) and tortoise carapace on the
upper (3,<i>j</i>) side of the same piece seem an exaggeration
from normal Mohave style. In my field catalogue I
entered <i>d</i> as "dish-like spoon"; and <i>e</i>, two years later,
simply as "oval spoon," which is confirmed by the notation:
kam'óta kapeta, viz., "tortoise spoon."</p>

<p>The two katéla or parchers, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>, having adjacent
numbers, 13787 and 13788, are probably out of one household&mdash;a
conservative one, inasmuch as they were secured
in 1908. They differ slightly in proportions, yet are closely
similar. Piece <i>f</i>, the longer and flatter, has its ends
brought into a semblance of the abbreviated quail beaks
and eyes found on some spoons&mdash;class A2. The rims of
both <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are transversely flat and wiped or pinched
over inward to extra thickness, then scored regularly
with a fingernail or stick; in <i>g</i> the outer edge has also
been lightly punch-marked.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The canteen in its net, <i>h</i>, no. 13793, has evidently seen
use. This was the kind taken on journeys. There is a
faded design of three vertical figures in double outline.
Each of these consists of three near-rhomboids set on
top of one another, with the joints between them open, so
that the three of them appear as a single figure. Within
each of the figures and between them there are dots 4-6
mm. in diameter. The bottom of the vessel is unpainted.</p>

<p>The plain duck seed-bin or canteen <i>i</i>, no. 4297, would
be practical for use sitting in the sand in the house or
under the ramada shade. It contained melon seeds when I

<p>The convex backs of spoons <i>a</i>-<i>i</i> are not the only painted
ones, but show the more ambitious attempts, if this adjective
is applicable to rudeness of their degree. The prevalent
painting is lengthwise striping, though crosswise (<i>i</i>),
and both ways (<i>d</i>), occur. The lengthwise stripes may be
plain lengthwise lines (<i>b</i>,<i>g</i>); heavy stripes with light (<i>e</i>)
or with rows of dots (<i>f</i>); flanked by multiple zigzags and
forming the fish backbone design (<i>c</i>,<i>h</i>); negative effect
(<i>e</i>). Piece <i>a</i> is irregularly interesting: three diagonally
curved lines sweep across the convex back, and are subdivided
by transverse lines into about a dozen triangles
and quadrilaterals of unlike shapes; nine of these contain
a polygonal spot or daub.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>PLATE 8: JAR, CUP, PLATTER,
BOWLS, SPOONS</b></p>

<p>This plate comprises vessels of various shapes which
I had at first intended not to illustrate or which had been
overlooked.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>a</i>, large water jar, 13791, classing with pl. 5,<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>.
Rim diameter 255 mm., neck 227, maximum body
diameter 315, height 255. The design is of large solid
hourglass figures separating rhomboidal-hexagonal
areas each bordered by double lines and containing
about 35 oval-round spots about 7-12 mm. across.
The pattern recalls that of the interior of pl. 3,<i>d</i>.</p>

<p><i>b</i>, handled cup, 38406, of the type of pl. 5,<i>h</i>,<i>i</i>.
Mohave provenience assumed. Rim d. 100, h. 70.
Interior design, 6 radiating lanceolate or petaloid
areas, double-line bordered, containing from 33 to
50 spots. There are small solid triangles where the
"petal" borders meet, and dots also in the peripheral
spaces. The handle is striped crosswise; the outside
of the vessel, vertically. Compare pl. 5,<i>h</i>,<i>i</i>.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, <i>under</i> side of platter 1722, front shown in pl. 3,<i>d</i>;
d. 203 mm. The design is a solid dark and light checker
of 25 whole or partial squares.</p>

<p><i>d</i>, bowl, 1721, d. 220 mm., h. 135, ratio 61 per
cent. Design: the forked-and-angled pattern, crudely
executed, and called teít&#952;ôk face paint. The dots were
named hatúhk, rows of tattoo dots. The <i>outside</i> is
painted with crossing lines, forming triangles and
diamonds, called sóaka, small net.</p>

<p><i>e</i>, large bowl, 1746, d. 320, h. 150, ratio 47 per
cent. Wt. 41 oz. The interior design, called atalyke
hamalye, leaves of an edible tuber-bearing plant, is
fishnetlike: thin lines forming squares bisected by
diagonals running one way; or, a network of right-angled
triangles turning somewhat irregular toward
the vessel's rim. Opposite acute angles filled in solid.
This design apparently was begun by drawing 5 parallel
lines across the interior, demarcating 6 segments.
These were then crossed, nearly vertically, by 6
lines; and then by 6 diagonals. <i>Outside</i>, vertical stripes
10 or more mm. wide. There are three peglike projections,
irregularly spaced, to keep binding from slipping.
Two, broken off, are 7-8 mm. across; the third
projects 11 mm.</p>

<p><i>f</i>,<i>g</i> are <i>outside</i>-painted bowls, both with height 48
per cent of their rim diameter, almost the same as <i>e</i>.
<i>f</i>, 13777, d. 310, h. 150; thickness near bottom 7-9
mm., at neck 4.5-6, at lip 6.5-7; wt. 48 oz.&mdash;heaviest
piece in the collection. <i>g</i>, 13781, d. 165, h. 80; wt.
14 oz. The design of <i>f</i> is negative in effect: a band
of light diamonds reserved on darker background; they
are about twice as high as wide, and each is inner-outlined
with a dark border. The interior is dark and
worn smooth. The pattern of <i>g</i> is irregular: diagonals
sloping to the right, with left-sloping ones crossing
every other one of these; but to the side, the left-sloping
lines come thicker, the right-sloping ones are
omitted.</p>

<p><i>h</i>, 13790, is a fire-blackened bowl that has been
cooked in and the contents run over; d. 185, h. 125,
ratio 68 per cent. This is the maximum for a Mohave
bowl, though equaled by pl. 2,<i>g</i>; and the shape is still
that of a bowl rather than of a pot (olla) such as pl. 5,<i>c</i>.
The ratio of rim, neck, and body diameters is 100, 95,
97 per cent for 8,<i>h</i>, whereas the pot 5,<i>c</i> has 100, 91,
100 per cent, and its height is 77 instead of 68 per cent.</p>

<p><i>i</i>,<i>j</i>,<i>k</i>, 13811, 1750, 13806, are spoons, the first
blunt-topped, the last with 135° back-curved handle.
The maximum lengths are 135, 140, 167 mm. The
patterns are as follows.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>i</i>, no. 13811, outlined diamonds and triangles containing
from 9 to 4 dots. The surface is worn, and the arrangement
of figures of the two shapes may have been more regular
than now appears; but the painting was slovenly at best.</p>

<p><i>j</i>, no. 1750, very similar to the fishbone design of plate
4,<i>o</i>. There are 12 thinnish cross lines, each with four upward
angles. 8,<i>j</i> and 4,<i>o</i> are very similar and bear adjoining
numbers, 1750 and 1749, and were almost certainly
the product of the same hand.</p>

<p><i>h</i>, 13806, parallel line-angles, pointed right, then left,
then again right across the front of the hollow of the scoop.
These angles are formed by 18 or 19 cross lines.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>SUMMARY OF SHAPES</b></p>

<p><i>Bowls</i>: kwá&#952;ki. Diameter about twice the height; neck
concave, often strengthened with a lashing of mesquite
bark; lip gently everted; principal design inside; outside
design usually mere lines, stripes, rows of dots. H/D
down to 38 per cent, usually 45-61 per cent, in two cases
68 per cent&mdash;one of these has been cooked in. (Pls. 1,<i>a</i>-<i>h</i>,
2,<i>a</i>-<i>h</i>, 6,<i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, 8,<i>d</i>-<i>h</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Round platter or plate</i>: kayé&#952;a. Lipless; continuous
curvature. Principal design inside (above). H/D 29-35
percent. (Pls. 3,<i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, 8,<i>c</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Oval platter</i>: kayúka or kakápa. Like the last except
for being oval, with width/length percentage between 78
and 89. They also average smaller than the round plates&mdash;modes
around 160 mm. and 260 mm. respectively; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>the two classes do overlap in size. (Pls. 3,<i>e</i>-<i>f</i>, <i>h</i>-<i>j</i>,
6,<i>d</i>-<i>e</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Spoon</i>, <i>ladle</i>, <i>dipper</i>, <i>scoop</i>: kam'óta. These are
oval trays brought at one end to (A) a point or rude quail's
head, or (B) to a sharp rounding or blunt point. The
second type is obviously related in form to the oval
platters; though most spoons are longer than most platters.
Their range is from 113 to 226 mm. Painted design
on the inner side varied; on the back it is usually
simpler, but also varied. A few spoons are built up at
the "handle" into a hollow box that rattles.</p>

<p><i>Parcher</i>: katéla. As the spoons can be construed as
oval platters pointed at one end, the parchers&mdash;used to
shake live coals with grain or seeds&mdash;are two-ended,
with well-raised points. They are about twice as long as
spoons, and longer than any known platters or bowls:
340-385 mm., with a width about seven-tenths that. They
are wholly unpainted. (Pl. 6,<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>.)</p>

<p>The five foregoing shapes are all "open" and relatively
flat. There are about the same number of "tall" shapes&mdash;pots,
jars, jugs, etc. But these are represented by
notably fewer specimens. Whether this disproportion
existed in precontact times, I do not know. It is possible
that cooking vessels and containers of American make
had begun to crowd out native forms by 1902-1908 faster
than bowls, platters, and spoons were being displaced.</p>

<p><i>Cook pot</i>: táskyena. The single specimen available,
5,<i>c</i>, is about the size of a bowl but higher (77 per cent
as against 68 per cent maximum); mouth and body diameter
the same, neck constricted 9 to 10 per cent. No
handles, paint, or decoration.</p>

<p><i>Large cook pot</i>: t&#353;uváva. Set on three rests. It may
have been proportionally higher than the táskyena, but
my recollection is fifty years old.</p>

<p><i>Water jar</i>: hápurui. Unhandled, painted. The largest
dimension is the body diameter, usually below the middle.
Next largest dimension is the height, though in one case
this is about equaled by the mouth diameter. The neck
has from 80 to 87 per cent the diameter of the mouth.</p>

<p>One specimen (5,<i>a</i>) differs from the two others in showing
considerably more taper from body to neck and mouth
and in having an annular base. The contained volume
would be around a gallon or up. (Pls. 5,<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, 8,<i>a</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Oval seed-storage jar (or canteen) with short side
spout</i>: hápurui hanemó, "duck jar" from its shape. The
single specimen is unpainted. (Pl. 6,<i>i</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Seed jar with small flaring mouth.</i> See Appendix I.</p>

<p><i>Canteen for carrying</i> in sling or net. Short spout on
top, as in a basket or gourd. One specimen, painted.
(Pl. 6,<i>h</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Handled jug</i>: no native name obtained, except hápurui,
jar, or kwá&#952;ki, bowl. May be a postcontact form. Higher
than wide; no spout. Painted outside. (Pl. 5,<i>d</i>-<i>g</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Handled cup</i>: also unnamed, except perhaps kwá&#952;ki,
and perhaps postcontact. Wider than high. Painted design
mainly inside. (Pls. 5,<i>h</i>-<i>i</i>, 8,<i>b</i>.)</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>TRANSITIONAL AND EXCEPTIONAL
PIECES</b></p>

<p>Bowls with principal painting outside: 8,<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>Bowls of height more than two-thirds diameter: 2,<i>g</i>,
base somewhat conical; 8,<i>h</i>, fire blackened.</p>

<p>Bowl with cylindrical projections to prevent slip of
neck binding: 8,<i>e</i>.</p>

<p>Transition bowl-platter with 11 flanges to hold binding;
no neck or recurved rim; H/D ratio 38 per cent on
border between bowl and round platter classes. The diameter
is greater than that of any other bowl or platter in
the collection (8,<i>e</i> is next), and the weight is second
heaviest (8,<i>f</i> being first): 6,<i>c</i>. Called suyíre.</p>

<p>Spoon with ribbon handle curled back (only "handled"
spoon): 8,<i>k</i>.</p>

<p>Water jar with annular base (found otherwise only on
handled jugs), and considerably reduced neck and mouth:
5,<i>a</i>.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>SUMMARY OF PAINTED DESIGNS AND ELEMENTS</b></p>

<p><i>"Angled-and-forked" continuous pattern</i>: usually of
triple lines; background stippled or empty. Bowls 1,<i>a</i>-<i>h</i>,
2,<i>e</i>, 8,<i>d</i>; platters 3,<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, 3,<i>g</i> (called "fish bones"); spoon
4,<i>b</i>; jar 5,<i>a</i>, jug 5,<i>g</i>; cup 5,<i>i</i>. I did not obtain a name
for this design as an overall pattern. Some element in it,
perhaps the filled-in angle, was twice denominated
t&#353;it&#952;ôk face paint.</p>

<p><i>"Hourglass" figures</i>: (1) as principal design, bowl
2,<i>f</i>; platter 3,<i>d</i>; spoons 4,<i>a</i>, 4,<i>d</i> (in rows), 4,<i>q</i>; jar 8,<i>a</i>;
jug 5,<i>e</i>. (2) as secondary design element with rhomboids,
bowls 2,<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>; spoons 4,<i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>m</i> with diamonds in column.
The hourglass figure can of course be construed as
the "filled-in angle" enlarged.</p>

<p><i>Quadrilaterals-hexagons</i>, shifting from one to the
other according to exigencies of the field. The mark <sup>+</sup>
designates painted figures, that are dark; others are
open, left as part of the lighter background, or stippled.</p>

<p>D. In columns: spoons 4,<i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <sup>+</sup><i>m</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Rows of dark and light triangles</i>: bowls 2,<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>; spoons
4,<i>l</i>, <i>q</i> (these spaced and "geared"); 2,<i>b</i>, 4,<i>l</i>, <i>q</i> named
coyote teeth; jug 5,<i>d</i>, named tattoo points.</p>

<p><i>Fishbone (fish backbone) pattern</i>: of parallel angled
lines, from one to four chevrons in each line. Usually
about half the angles are filled in; this is indicated by the
asterisk *.</p>

<blockquote><p>A. With vertebral column shown by central line:
platter *3,<i>g</i> (transitional to angled-and-forked
pattern); spoons 4,<i>e</i> (with stippling), *4,<i>o</i>, 7,<i>h</i>

2,<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>; platter 8,<i>c</i> outside.</p>
<p>C. Seeming negative, owing to masses of dark polygons:

<p class="p2 center"><b>SUMMARY OF DESIGN NAMES</b></p>

<p>Designs are named most frequently after animals or
their parts, once after a leaf. Next most frequent are
names derived from patterns of face painting or tattooing.
A few are descriptive, like "patches," "zigzag."</p>

<p><i>Animals or parts.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>Fish (back)bone: 3,<i>c</i>, 3,<i>g</i>, 4,<i>o</i>, 4,<i>q</i>, 5,<i>g</i>, 6,<i>a</i>
outside</p>
<p>Fish tail (?): 2,<i>h</i> outside</p>
<p>Coyote teeth: 2,<i>d</i>, 4,<i>l</i>, 4,<i>q</i></p>
<p>Raccoon hand: 6,<i>a</i>, 6,<i>b</i>, 4,<i>p</i></p>
<p>Yellowhammer belly: 1,<i>a</i></p>
<p>Tortoise: 3,<i>j</i>, 6,<i>e</i> outside</p>
<p>Spider: 2,<i>h</i>, 3,<i>i</i>, 6,<i>d</i> outside</p>
<p>Butterfly: 2,<i>f</i>; "in mouth," 4,<i>d</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Plant parts.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>(Cottonwood) leaves: 3,<i>d</i>, 8,<i>e</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Of these, coyote teeth, yellow-hammer belly, butterfly,
and (atalyka) leaf occur also as names of face paintings
(Handbook, p. 732, fig. 61,<i>b</i>-<i>e</i>).</p>
<p>The Handbook (p. 738) mentions a few additional names
for pottery designs: rain, rainbow (this also a face painting),
melon markings.</p>

<p><i>Face paintings or tattoo.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>t&#353;it&#952;ôk: 3,<i>d</i>, 5,<i>a</i>. This seems to denote an element
in what I have called the forked-and-angled pattern of
plate 1. Also recorded as t&#353;itgôk.</p>

<p>hotahpave, "halter": 2,<i>f</i>, 5,<i>e</i>. It seems to refer to
paired crossing lines as part of hourglass figures. In
Handbook (fig. 61,<i>i</i>-<i>j</i>) it appears as point-to-point
chevrons on the cheeks.</p>

<p>ta-tsirqa-tsirqa: 1,<i>d</i>. In Handbook (fig. 61,<i>k</i>, <i>l</i>) it
appears as sharp points under the eyes (cf. ibid., fig.
61,<i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, "ha-tsira-tsirk," a vertical line down from
the eye).</p>

<p>ta-skilye-skilye: 5,<i>d</i>. Reference is to a column of
horizontal points at the edge of one style of women's
chin tattoo. (See Handbook, p. 521, fig. 46,<i>q</i>.)</p>

<p>iya-m-t&#353;upe(r)t(a): 2,<i>g</i>. Iya is the mouth; t&#353;upeta,
to hold back or cover.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>"Adjectivally" descriptive.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>ta-hlame-hlame, "patches": 1,<i>b</i>, 4,<i>d</i></p>
<p>kyauelkyau, "angled, zigzag": 4,<i>g</i></p>
<p>kan'ú (?), "patterned": 2,<i>b</i></p></blockquote>

<p>It is evident that there is no deeper symbolic significance
in the pattern names. They are like our crow's
foot, horseshoe, pigtail, fleur-de-lys, diamond, spade,
wavy, broken&mdash;metaphorically or directly descriptive.
The Mohave in addition have available a number of striking
and familiar types of designs with which women ornament
their faces.</p>

<p>In their actual, though of course transient, face decoration,
the Mohave, though not quite the artistic equals of
the Seri, paint with far more care, neatness, and precision
than they bestow on their pottery. It is significant
that it is the patterns of pottery that are named after
those painted on their cheeks, not the reverse.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>THE MOHAVE POTTERY STYLE</b></p>

<p>Mohave pottery was made in a culture which set little
intrinsic value on anything technological and looked upon
economic acquisition as in itself unworthy and fit only for
dissipation. Artifacts were used but not prized; and they
all perished upon their owner's death.</p>

<p>Certain qualities of Mohave pottery are expectable as
a product of this atmosphere: lack of evenness and finish
or precision, the appearance of haste or indifference in
manufacture. Surfaces are not quite true or even, thicknesses
variable, firing intensity somewhat spotty; diameters
vary enough for the eye to see some lopsidedness
from the round, or sway in the level of a rim. Particularly
in the painted designs, which do not contribute to
functional use, inequalities, crowding, wavering lines,
departures from symmetry, are all conspicuous.</p>

<p>At the same time the ware is never incompetent. It
has reasonable strength, toughness, hardness for its
purpose. Its shapes are definite and well standardized.
It never tries merely to get by. This is proved by the
fact that, except for vessels like cook pots and parchers,
where decoration would be wasted, painting is the rule,
and mostly, painting on both sides. The execution of this
painting is often enough slovenly; but it is firm in aim.
There are a series of design patterns more or less fitted
to the several shapes; there is considerable choice between
these, and even more freedom of adaptation to
shape of field. Timidity was not one of the earmarks of
the Mohave potter; if her pattern came out neatly, well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and good; if uneven or crowded, there was no harm done.
Standards were not particularly high, especially not as
regards exactness; but they called for vigor of approach.
Emphasis is on the overall effect of pattern, not on its
items. The continuous forked-and-angled design, the
combinations of hourglass figures, of spaced rhomboids
or hexagons, even the simpler fishbone pattern&mdash;all have
this total-field approach, with relative indifference to
figure elements that got squeezed, stretched, or distorted.</p>

<p>Some of these patterns, especially the forked-and-angled
continuous or interlocking one, are not easy to
plan or apply with reference to a given field, whether
circular or otherwise; yet they are attempted again and
again with a slapdash gusto.</p>

<p>Elements like the triple line, or an extra line shadowing
the edge of a solid area, or a row of dots following
an inner or outer contour, or the filling either of figures
or background with stippled spots, and the superabundant
solid-filled angles&mdash;either opposite or apart&mdash;are simple
enough to execute in themselves; but the frequency of
their use, often of two or three of them at once, are evidence
that the Mohave potter was at least not skimping
her decoration, even though she was unworried if it came
out skew or ragged. After all, these details might have
simply been left out instead of being executed.</p>

<p>In fundamental form, the bowls, platters, parchers
are pleasing; and in design and its relation to its field,
vessels like 1,<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, 2,<i>g</i>, 3,<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>&mdash;or 3,<i>c</i>, <i>e</i>, 5,<i>g</i>; or 4,<i>g</i>;
<i>h</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>p</i>; or 3,<i>d</i>, 4,<i>r</i>&mdash;show concepts that in the hands of
a more interested or aesthetically more experienced population
would have had definite potentialities.</p>

<p>There is then a standard in the Mohave pottery art,
and behind this a tradition. How this tradition grew will
be gradually worked out as a corpus of published data on
the ceramic wares of other tribes of the region becomes
available, and especially as archaeological information
accumulates. Personally, I have always assumed that
Colorado River ware as represented by historic Yuma
and Mohave pottery was a variant in a cotradition that
includes also Hohokam, much of Sonora, and probably
southern California. This seems also the basic view
of Malcom Rogers, Schroeder, Treganza, Meighan,
my present collaborator Harner, and the few others
who have concerned themselves with Colorado Valley
pottery. But of course the full story is long and
complex; and the present description and Harner's
analysis are merely thresholds from which the problem
can be really entered. Rogers' "Yuman Pottery Making"
is a useful preliminary survey and stimulating. Meanwhile
a Patayan tradition has been set up for the mountains
and desert east of the Mohave habitat along the
Colorado. But we have scant information on the Patayan
development, and that little seems quite different from
the historic Mohave one. So far as there may be resemblances,
I hope that our present detailed contribution will
induce those who know Patayan to point out in print such
similarities as they discern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX I</h2>

<p class="center"><b>MEMORANDA ON THE DESTROYED ACADEMY COLLECTION</b></p>

<p>The Mohave ethnological collection which was destroyed
by fire at the California Academy of Sciences in
San Francisco in 1906 consisted of 67 items, according
to a record preserved in my notebook 7. Of these 67,
32 were pottery vessels and 12 were ceramic ancillaries.
The latter consisted of four paddles, three pebbles used
as anvils, yellow pigment, two samples of potter's clay,
one of clay pounded small, and a sample of fine-crushed
rock for tempering.</p>

<p>The vessels comprised:</p>

<blockquote><p>11 bowls, one of them of kwá&#952;ki shape; mostly
listed by me as "dishes"; they may include some
platters</p>
<p>3 bowllike vessels, listed as: "kwá&#952;ki, small
pot"; "suyíre, round dish"; "t&#353;emát&#353;ive, pot with
designs inside and out"</p>
<p>1 "dish, corrugated outside"</p>
<p>9 spoons</p>
<p>1 fire-blackened pot</p>
<p>1 cup, named as "kwá&#952;ki aha-surait&#353;i"</p>
<p>1 jar, "hápurui, water jug"</p>
<p>2 seed jars, described as: "25, water jug, wheat
jar, aha-t&#353;e-kemauvit&#353;e, in halves, rejoined with
mesquite gum"; and "39, jar, top sealed with mesquite
gum; contains melon seeds for roasting and pounding;
to take them out, the mouth of the jar is set on hot
coals"</p>
<p>2 parchers, double-ended</p>
<p>1 jar with rope handle (canteen like pl. 6, <i>h</i>? or a
water jar carried by a rope around its neck?)</p></blockquote>

<p>I do not know whether in 1900 I meant the same by jar,
jug, pot as now. My "dish" of then may have included
some platters as well as bowls. I was not using the term
"bowl"; and "pot" seems to have designated sometimes a
cook pot or olla, sometimes simply any open pottery
vessel, including bowls. Nor can I imagine now what I
may have meant by the "corrugation" on a dish. A cup
is mentioned, but called a special kind of kwá&#952;ki. If the
"hápurui, water jug" was handled, it would show that
handled jugs were called by the same name as widemouthed
jars, hápurui. The two seed jars were evidently
of the small-necked and small-mouthed type discussed in
connection with the Chemehuevi seed jar no. 13875.</p>

<p>The design names obtained in 1900 were:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fish bones, fish back, usually written atci&#952;tatr
(= at&#353;ita&#7789;): on four spoons and one "dish."</p>

<p>Spider, haldâda (for halytô&#7789;a), on one "pot." I
sketched the core of the pattern: an hourglass figure
(meeting angles) with double lines from the corners.</p>

<p>Cottonwood leaf, on three spoons and the jar
with rope handle</p>

<p>Matit&#353;iav leaf (a bush growing away from river),
on one spoon</p>

<p>Turtle (viz., carapace markings), on one spoon</p>

<p>Hotaxpam, on the t&#353;emát&#353;ive "pot," also on one
spoon; described as a red X painted below the eyes
by women; hotaxpave, halter, the cross-strap being
near the horse's eye</p>

<p>Kari hanyóra, "basket pattern," on the outside of
a dish</p>

<p>Rain, kovau, on two dish-pots; on the outside in at
least one</p>

<p>Rainbow, kwalisei, on the outside of two "dishes"
and one spoon. I think these are simply stripes or
parallel lines on the under side. Rainbow occurs also
as a design on women's wooden dice, and as a face
paint.</p>

<p>Fishnet, once on the outside of a "dish"</p>

<p>Melon markings, kamíto hanyóra, on one of the
seed-water jars</p>

<p>Clouds were given as the name of the "corrugations"
on dish no. 46. I evidently asked a foolish question.</p></blockquote>

<p>Handbook of California Indians (fig. 64, p. 738) shows
a typical bowl and spoon from this Academy collection,
which I had drawn before their destruction. The bowl
pattern is outside, consists of heavy stripes and thin lines,
and was called "rain." The spoon pattern was probably
on the inside, was called "fish backbone," and is similar
to that of plate 4,<i>f</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>s</i>.</p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX II</h2>

<p class="center"><b>A SMALL MOHAVE BOWL</b></p>

<p>About 1908 I was given or purchased as a souvenir
a small bowl which is now Peabody Museum no. 54-41-10/34461.
It is a typical bowl except for being smaller
than any in the University collection.</p>

<p>It is 123 mm. in diameter, 64 in height; H/D ratio is
therefore 52 per cent. The ridge is finished with a horizontally
flat edge 4-5 mm. wide. I estimate the mean
thickness of the ware as around 4 mm. The weight is 7 oz.
There is a mesquite lashing below the rim with three
knots in it.</p>

<p>The inner side is worn by use, and parts of the design
are no longer plain. The basic element is the raccoon hand,
of which there were originally 20 to 24 units. Each of these
consists of a solid red triangle, isosceles or equilateral,
with sides of 15-20 mm. From each triangle project four
digits&mdash;bars 6-12 mm. long. The hands are scattered
rather evenly over the field, but pointing in all directions:
toward the center, toward the rim, or across the circle.
Between the hand units there are red dots 2-3 mm. in
diameter.</p>

<p>The under side carries 41 vertical (radiating) lines 1-2
mm. wide and 30-80 mm. long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><b>GRANITE TEMPER AND LIMONITE PIGMENT EXAMINATION</b><br />
<b>By</b><br />
<b>PROFESSOR CHARLES MEYER</b></p>

<p>The piece of granite, no. 4326, used for temper is
high in quartz (20-25 per cent) and potash feldspar (35-40
per cent), with perhaps 10 per cent of black mica
now chloritized. The remainder is probably soda-rich
plagioclase, a feldspar. This is a very acid granite,
silica probably constituting around 70 per cent of the
total mass. As a result, as the rock surface weathered,
it would not wash off as clay but would maintain hard
spicules and sharp angles of quartz useful as temper.</p>

<p>The limonite pigment, no. 4295, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>·n(+)H<sub>2</sub>O, has
mostly crystallized on exposure to become toethite,
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>·nH<sub>2</sub>O. If originally derived from a sulphide, none
of this seems to remain. Some clay is contained and a
little quartz silt; also some carbonate in the form of
calcite, which acts as a cement for the whole; but the
total of silicates and carbonates, that is, noniron oxide,
is not over 10 per cent. On roasting, the water content
is driven off, and the remaining Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is red. A reducing
heating with carbon however produces magnetic
powder Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, a black pigment.</p>

<p class="center"><b>MOHAVE POTTERY IN OTHER MUSEUMS</b></p>

<p>In 1934 F. H. Douglas, of the Denver Art Museum,
wrote my colleague Gifford about Mohave pottery which
he had seen on display in various museums, without
special search of catalogues or storerooms. The list
may still be useful.</p>

<p>U. S. National Museum: 25 vessels, mostly old, many
collected by Palmer, some evidently mislabeled Diegueño
or Pimo. One anvil stone. [<i>Yuma</i>, a bowl and a 5-necked
vase, from Palmer; the Yuma went in for "fancy" or
tourist pieces earlier than the Mohave. <i>Cocopa</i>, McGee
got 4 plates, a Mohave type dipper, unpainted, 2 paddles.]</p>

<p>Peabody Museum, Harvard: 10 vessels collected by
Edward Palmer in 1876, viz., 1 very large jar, 2 other
jars, 1 tiny jar, 3 bowls, 3 dippers; also 2 pottery dolls,
a paddle, an anvil stone, a "vessel of mud and straw."
There is also a pottery doll secured by Jules Marcou in
1854&mdash;he must have been on the Whipple Expedition! [I
have seen this lot and, like everything Palmer got, it is
excellent. Together with National Museum pieces, these
of Palmer's are the most important collection of Mohave
pottery extant. There seem to be no handled vessels; but
there are dolls&mdash;besides Marcou's. The Palmer collections,
formed twenty-five to thirty years before mine,
will be the touchstone of the "purity" of mine. From
having seen the Palmer material, I am confident that
Mohave native ware had not been <i>seriously</i> impaired
technologically or stylistically by 1902-1908; but it must
have been affected somewhat&mdash;the railroad came through
in 1886&mdash;and it will be desirable to know at what points it
had begun to change.&mdash;A. L. K.]</p>

<p>Chicago Natural History Museum: 8 vessels (bowls,
dippers, jars, canteen), also 3 dolls, collected in 1901.
[The date points to Owen, who was in southern California
about then. From Yuma, one painted, one unpainted bowl.]</p>

<p>Museum of the American Indian: 15 assorted pieces,
3 of them unpainted. [Same number from <i>Yuma</i>]. [Possibly
Edward Davis of Mesa Grande collected these.]</p>

<p>University of Pennsylvania: [2 <i>Yuma</i> pottery dolls].</p>

<p>Denver Art Museum: 3 human-headed vases, pre-1900.
Also 5 brand-new pieces bought at Needles in 1934.</p>

<p>It is curious that none of these collections have been
described, except possibly for stray pieces in nonethnographic
connections. They aggregate into a group probably
at least as large as that discussed here; perhaps
considerably larger when the storerooms shall have been
examined.</p>

<p class="center"><b>A DESCRIPTION FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGIST</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>PARKER RED-ON-BUFF, FORT MOHAVE VARIANT
AND PARKER BUFF, FORT MOHAVE VARIANT</b></p>

<p class="center">BY</p>

<p class="center">MICHAEL J. HARNER</p>


<p class="p2 center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>

<p>The following analysis of the Mohave pottery collected
by Professor Kroeber is primarily for the use of the
archaeologist to aid him in identifying historic Mohave
ceramics. Not represented in the collection is pottery
made by the Mohave south of Parker. Some typological
differences may exist between the pottery of those settlements
and the pottery in Kroeber's collection, which is
from Mohave Valley. In addition, the evidence seems to
indicate that Mohave ceramics were undergoing changes
in the late historic period. Since the historic period can
be considered to extend back to the time of the first Spanish
contacts, other chronologically significant "historic"
Mohave pottery types or type variants may be discerned
through additional research. For these reasons "Fort
Mohave" is introduced here as a variant or subtype name
in preference to using "Historic Mohave" which is felt to
be too inclusive a term.</p>

<p>In referring to historic Mohave pottery, Malcolm
Rogers (1945, p. 179) once used the name "Needles Red-on-Buff."
However, the description of Needles Red-on-Buff
by Colton (1939, pp. 12-13) and the use of that type
name by Schroeder (1952, p. 32) indicate that each has in
mind a type distinguishable from the pottery described
in this paper. At the same time, Schroeder (1952, p. 20)
clearly considers that his Parker types include historic
Mohave pottery within their typological range, and I am
of the same opinion. The descriptions of Parker Red-on-Buff,
Parker Buff, and Parker Stucco by Schroeder (1952,
pp. 19-22) agree in basic characteristics with most of the
pottery described in the present paper. However, some
forms which do not seem to occur prehistorically in the
Lower Colorado Buff Ware, such as cups, ring bases
and keels, are present in the late historic collection
described here. Such new forms can be of definite use
as chronological diagnostics, but it is difficult to justify
setting up a new type on the basis of them alone. Consequently,
the qualification "Fort Mohave variant" has
been added to the Parker type names to denote this late
historic pottery complex. When more detailed descriptions
are available for the earlier ceramics of the Parker
Series, the typological contrast may prove to be of sufficient
scope to warrant classifying the Fort Mohave variants
as full-fledged types. In any case, such descriptions
must be made before useful comparisons can be attempted.</p>

<p>The description which follows does not include pottery
figurines, toys, rattles, pipes, or pot rests. Also one
undecorated jar<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was not included in the study.</p>

<p>Techniques of description used here are almost entirely
based upon Colton and Hargrave (1937), Shepard
(MS), and Gifford (1953); the latter paper being also the
source of the paint permanency scale.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Color analysis is
based upon the Munsell Soil Color Chart and hardness
tests upon Moh's scale. Depth and diameter measurements
refer to exterior dimensions.</p>

</p>

<p>Since the size of the collection leaves much to be desired,
particularly as regards Parker Buff, Fort Mohave
variant, the writer wishes to emphasize that the definitions
of these variants are only tentative and hopes that
others will not hesitate to revise them in the light of additional
evidence.</p>

<p><b>Size of sample</b>: 33 bowls; 4 jars; 7 cups; and 29 scoops.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p><b>Construction technique</b>: Coiling.</p>
<p><b>Finishing technique</b>: Paddle and anvil.</p>
<p><b>Firing</b>: Fully to incompletely oxidized.</p>
<p><b>Paste</b>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Range: hue 2.5YR to 10R; value 6 to 7; chroma
4 to 6. Most common: 2.5YR 6/5 (between a weak
reddish orange and a weak orange.)</p>
<p><i>Temper.</i>&mdash;Size: average .4 mm. (fine); maximum 1.4
mm. (coarse); minimum microscopic. Greatest
range between average and maximum observed in
a single vessel is .4 to 1.3 mm. Kind: predominantly
white angular and subangular particles (feldspar)
together with a small amount of white rounded
particles (quartz). Some mica (copper-colored) is
present, but except for a few vessels is hardly
noticeable.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> No sherd temper is visible. Amount:
When seen in cross section the amount of the paste
surface occupied by temper particles ranges from
ca. 30 per cent to ca. 50 per cent; the average
being ca. 40 per cent.</p>
<p><i>Carbon streak.</i>&mdash;None.</p>
<p><i>Texture.</i>&mdash;Rough.</p>
<p><i>Hardness.</i>&mdash;Where the paste is buff-colored: range of
hardness is 2 to 6.5; average is 4. Where the paste
is grayish: range 3.5 to 8.5; average 6.5. These
hardness ratings can be in error ± .5 owing to
variability in the mineral set used for testing.</p>

<p><i>Fracture.</i>&mdash;Medium to crumbling.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Surface finish</b>: Anvil depressions are generally discernible
on interior surfaces of vessels. Surfaces are uniformly
smoothed, but not polished. All vessels are
unslipped (a few scoops have a sliplike surface appearance,
owing to one or both of their surfaces being completely
painted over; but the painting marks make it
evident that these are not applications of the clay wash
that characterizes a true slip.).</p>

neutral brown). Interior: range of hue 2.5YR to
10YR; value 3 to 8; chroma 1 to 8. Most common:
2.5YR 6/7 (weak to moderate orange).</p>

<p><i>Jars.</i>&mdash;Exterior: range of hue 10R to 10YR; value 3 to

chroma same as for exterior surface; value 4 to 8.
Most common: 5YR 7/4 (between moderate orange-pink
and weak yellowish orange).</p>

<p><i>Scoops.</i>&mdash;(For colors of completely painted-over surfaces,
consult section on "Decoration.") Exterior:
range of hue 2.5YR to 7.5YR; value 2 to 8; chroma
1 to 6. Most common: 5YR 5/4 (between pale reddish
brown and moderate yellowish brown). Interior:
range of hue and value same as for exterior; chroma
1 to 7. Most common: 5YR 6/4 (between weak reddish
orange and light yellowish brown).</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Fire clouds</b>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Placement.</i>&mdash;Occur on any part of the exteriors of all
classes of vessels; never occur on the interiors of
bowls, but sometimes on the interiors of jars, cups
and scoops. Indistinct in shape.</p>

<p><i>Amount.</i>&mdash;Every vessel has at least one fire cloud on
its exterior surface. Presence of fire clouds on the

surface of the vessel, starting at
the handle end and tapering in the amount
of projection as it approaches the base of
the scoop. (c) Dimensions: range of keel

have the "eyes" and "keel" previously described.
<br />
Rattle handle: (a) Nature of feature: a single
closed compartment containing some loose,
small, hard objects (probably pebbles or
pottery pellets). (b) Placement: located
in the handle of the scoop and with its length
oriented along the length of the handle. (c)
Dimensions: compartment occupies less
than one-half the total length of the vessel.
Its exact dimensions are uncertain, since
none of the handles are broken open; probably
the interior length ranges from ca. 30
to ca. 49 mm. and the interior width from
ca. 32 to ca. 55 mm.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b></p>

<p><b>Synonym</b>: None.</p>
<p><b>Variant named for</b>: Fort Mohave Reservation.</p>
<p><b>Illustrations</b>: This publication.</p>
<p><b>Type specimens</b>: Mohave pottery collection at the University
of California Museum of Anthropology; specifically,
specimens 1/13788, 1/13789, 1/13790, and
1/15707.</p>
<p><b>Type sites</b>: Same as for Parker Red-on-Buff, Fort Mohave
variant.</p>
<p><b>Cultural association</b>: Same as for Parker Red-on-Buff,
Fort Mohave variant.</p>
<p><b>Time</b>: Same as for Parker Red-on-Buff, Fort Mohave
variant.</p>
<p><b>Size of sample</b>: 2 bowls; 2 parchers.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>

<p><b>Construction technique and finishing technique</b>: The same
as for Parker Red-on-Buff, Fort Mohave variant; firing
and paste characteristics are likewise within the range
described for that type.</p>

<p><b>Surface finish</b>: Anvil depressions are generally discernible
on interior surfaces of vessels. All vessels are
unslipped. Interior surfaces of all vessels and the exterior
of one parcher and part of the exterior of the
other are smooth, but not polished. The exterior surfaces
of the bowls and part of the exterior of one of
the parchers have an extremely rough, granular surface,
called "stucco."</p>

<p><b>Surface color</b>: Exterior surfaces of bowls are covered
with the soot from cooking fires. Interior surfaces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>parchers and one bowl are likewise uniformly blackened
through use. Otherwise the surface color is
visible and within the range described for Parker
Red-on-Buff, Fort Mohave variant.</p>

<p><b>Fire clouds</b>: These are partially visible on the exteriors
of the parchers and may be present on the exterior
and interior surfaces elsewhere. However, the considerable
smoke-blackening prevents adequate observation
of them (removal of a portion of the soot on the
exterior of one bowl revealed one such cloud).</p>

<p><b>Form</b>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Bowls.</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Profile form type: IV.
<br />
Lip and rim types: Lip type A. Rim types 1 and 2,
sometimes grading into types 4 and 5 respectively.
<br />
Shoulders: Rounded.
<br />
Base: Rounded.
<br />
Mouth diameter range: 18.5 to 25 cm.
<br />
Depth range: 13.4 to 19.8 cm.
<br />
Wall thickness range: (a) at rim, 5 to 9 mm.; (b)
at point of greatest incurve, 3.5 to 5 mm.; (c)
at center of vessel base, 6 to 8 mm.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Parchers.</i>&mdash;These are boatlike, double-pointed shapes.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Profile form types: XVII and XVIII.
<br />
Lip and rim types: Lip type B. Rim types 1 and 2.
<br />
Shoulders: None.
<br />
Base: Rounded.
<br />
Diameter range: range in maximum length is 34 to
38.1 cm.; range in maximum width is 23.9 to
26.6 cm.
<br />
Depth range: at point of maximum length, 13.7 to
13.9 cm.; at point of maximum width, 8.6 to
8.8 cm.
<br />
Wall thickness range: (a) at rim, 7 to 9 mm.; (b)
at a distance of 1 cm. below the rim, 5 to 6.5
mm.; (c) at center of vessel base, 5.5 to 7.5 mm.
<br />
Additional features: On one of the bowls and on
both of the parching trays the topmost coil, constituting
the rim and upper part of the lip, is
not completely flattened, resulting in what is
sometimes called a "folded rim." This makes
the rim and the lip thicker in cross section.
This "folded rim" is characterized by a treatment
of parallel, angular (fingernail?) indentations
both on the interior and exterior surfaces.
The distance from the rim to the bottom edge of
the fold ranges from 2.4 to 7 mm.
</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Painted decoration</b>: None.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2 center"><b>COMPARISON</b></p>

<p>Differs from Parker Red-on-Buff, Fort Mohave
variant, in not having painted decoration; and in having
a "stucco" surface and/or an indented "folded rim." The
parcher is a form which does not occur among the painted
vessels (i.e., as Parker Red-on-Buff, Fort Mohave
variant) in the collection.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
